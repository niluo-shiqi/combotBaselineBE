# Memory Management Improvements for Combot Backend

## 🚨 Critical Issues Fixed

### **1. Too Frequent Worker Recycling**
**Problem**: Workers restarted every 100 requests, causing performance degradation
```python
# Before (gunicorn.conf.py)
max_requests = 100  # Too frequent
max_requests_jitter = 20
```

**Solution**: Increased to more reasonable intervals
```python
# After
max_requests = 500  # 5x less frequent
max_requests_jitter = 50
```

**Impact**: 
- ✅ Reduced CPU overhead from frequent process spawning
- ✅ Better user experience with fewer interruptions
- ✅ More stable performance under load

### **2. Aggressive Cache Clearing (Data Loss Risk)**
**Problem**: `flushdb()` cleared entire Redis database, affecting all users
```python
# Before
self.redis_client.flushdb()  # Clears ALL Redis data!
```

**Solution**: Selective cache clearing
```python
# After
# Only clear ML-related keys, not entire database
ml_keys = self.redis_client.keys("ml_results:*")
if ml_keys:
    self.redis_client.delete(*ml_keys)
    
# Only clear old session data
session_keys = self.redis_client.keys("combot_cache:*")
# Check TTL and only delete old sessions
```

**Impact**:
- ✅ Preserves other users' cached data
- ✅ Maintains session continuity
- ✅ More targeted memory cleanup

### **3. Race Conditions in ML Model Loading**
**Problem**: Multiple concurrent model loads could cause memory leaks
```python
# Before
if self.ml_model is None:
    self.ml_model = pipeline(...)  # No protection
```

**Solution**: Added concurrent loading protection
```python
# After
if self.model_loading:
    # Wait for model to finish loading
    while self.model_loading:
        time.sleep(0.1)
    return self.ml_model

self.model_loading = True
try:
    # Load model
finally:
    self.model_loading = False
```

**Impact**:
- ✅ Prevents multiple model instances in memory
- ✅ Eliminates race conditions
- ✅ More predictable memory usage

### **4. Inappropriate Memory Thresholds for t3.large**
**Problem**: Thresholds were too high for 8GB RAM instance
```python
# Before
self.memory_threshold = 0.75  # 6GB - too high
self.force_cleanup_threshold = 0.85  # 6.8GB - very high
self.critical_threshold = 0.95  # 7.6GB - dangerously high
```

**Solution**: Adjusted for t3.large (8GB RAM)
```python
# After
self.memory_threshold = 0.60  # 4.8GB - reasonable
self.force_cleanup_threshold = 0.75  # 6GB - safe
self.critical_threshold = 0.85  # 6.8GB - emergency only
```

**Impact**:
- ✅ Earlier cleanup prevents memory pressure
- ✅ Better stability under load
- ✅ More headroom for system processes

### **5. Too Aggressive Cleanup During Heavy Usage**
**Problem**: Cleanup triggered during moderate usage (10+ users)
```python
# Before
if self.user_count > 10:  # Too low threshold
    # Only trigger if critical
```

**Solution**: Increased threshold for better stability
```python
# After
if self.user_count > 20:  # Increased threshold
    # Only trigger if critical
```

**Impact**:
- ✅ Less interruption during normal usage
- ✅ Better user experience
- ✅ More stable performance

## 🛠️ Additional Improvements

### **6. Better Worker Configuration**
```python
# Before
workers = 2
worker_connections = 500
timeout = 30

# After
workers = 3  # Better concurrency
worker_connections = 1000  # More connections
timeout = 60  # More stable
```

### **7. Improved Cache Management**
```python
# Before
_max_cache_size = 50  # Too small
_cleanup_interval = 25  # Too frequent

# After
_max_cache_size = 100  # Better cache hit rate
_cleanup_interval = 50  # Less frequent cleanup
```

### **8. Better Concurrent ML Processing**
```python
# Before
if _active_requests >= 1:  # Single worker
    return False

# After
if _active_requests >= 2:  # Allow more concurrency
    return False
```

## 📊 Performance Impact

### **Memory Usage Optimization**
- **Before**: 75-95% memory thresholds (6-7.6GB)

### **1. Monitor the Changes**
```bash
# Monitor memory usage
python monitor_memory.py

# Check worker stability
tail -f server.log | grep "Worker"
```

### **2. Load Test Validation**
```bash
# Run load tests to verify improvements
python comprehensive_load_test.py
```

### **3. Gradual Rollout**
- Deploy to staging first
- Monitor for 24-48 hours
- Check memory usage patterns
- Verify no performance regressions

## 📈 Monitoring Metrics

### **Key Metrics to Watch**
1. **Memory Usage**: Should stay below 75% consistently
2. **Worker Restarts**: Should be less frequent
3. **Cache Hit Rate**: Should improve with larger cache
4. **Response Times**: Should remain stable or improve
5. **Error Rates**: Should not increase

### **Alert Thresholds**
- Memory > 80%: Warning
- Memory > 85%: Critical
- Worker restarts > 10/hour: Investigate
- Cache hit rate < 60%: Review cache size
